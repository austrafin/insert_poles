# insert_poles
This program automatically inserts stobie poles (the most common type of power pole in South Australia) on a drawing to the coordinates and orientation specified in the PLS-CADD staking table. The headings of the staking table must be removed as well as the "empty" rows that may appear in the table. The staking table format must be converted into CSV.
